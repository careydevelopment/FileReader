# FileReader
This code demonstrates how to read a file line-by-line with a Stream and Files.lines.

To see the code in action, just run the ReadFile class. If you're in Eclipse, just right-click on that class,
select "Run As..." and select "Java Application."

Keep in mind that you can also run the ReadFileBufferedReader and RedFileFiltered classes the same way.
